# Homelab Security Hardening Project

**Author:** ssjlox
**Status:** In Progress
**Certifications:** CompTIA Security+
**Focus Areas:** Security Engineering, Infrastructure Security, Container Security

## Project Overview

This repository documents the systematic security audit, hardening, and monitoring implementation for a production homelab environment running 25+ containerized services, VMs, and network infrastructure.

**Objectives:**
1. Conduct comprehensive security audit of existing infrastructure
2. Implement defense-in-depth security controls
3. Establish continuous monitoring and vulnerability management
4. Document processes for portfolio demonstration and knowledge retention
5. Apply Security+ and Network+ concepts in real-world scenarios

## Infrastructure Scope

### Environment Details
- **Platform:** Unraid 6.x server
- **Containerization:** Docker (25+ containers)
- **Virtualization:** KVM/QEMU VMs
- **Networking:** Tailscale VPN, Pi-hole DNS, Nginx reverse proxy
- **Services:** Media servers, databases, web applications, monitoring tools

### Key Services Under Audit
- Nextcloud AIO (file sync/share platform)
- Jellyfin (media streaming)
- Sonarr/Radarr/Lidarr (media automation)
- Pi-hole (network-wide ad blocking & DNS)
- PostgreSQL & MariaDB (databases)
- Nginx Proxy Manager (reverse proxy)
- Multiple *arr stack applications

## Methodology

This project follows industry-standard security assessment practices:

1. **Reconnaissance & Inventory** - Document current state
2. **Vulnerability Identification** - Automated & manual scanning
3. **Risk Analysis** - Prioritize findings by severity
4. **Remediation** - Implement security controls
5. **Validation** - Verify fixes & document baselines
6. **Continuous Monitoring** - Ongoing security posture tracking

## Skills Demonstrated

**Technical Skills:**
- Linux system administration & hardening
- Docker container security
- Network security architecture
- PKI & certificate management
- Vulnerability assessment & management
- Security automation & scripting
- Log analysis & SIEM concepts

**Security Frameworks & Standards:**
- NIST Cybersecurity Framework
- CIS Benchmarks (Docker, Linux)
- Defense in Depth
- Zero Trust principles
- Least Privilege Access Control

**Tools & Technologies:**
- Docker & container security tools
- Network security appliances (Pi-hole, nginx)
- Vulnerability scanners (Trivy, Grype)
- Git version control
- Bash/Python scripting
- Tailscale VPN mesh networking

## Learning Objectives

As part of my cybersecurity career development, this project reinforces:

**Security+ Concepts:**
