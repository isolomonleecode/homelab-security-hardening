**STAR Format:**
- **Situation:** Context and background
- **Task:** Your responsibility/challenge
- **Action:** Specific steps you took
- **Result:** Quantified outcome

**Prepared Responses:**

**1. "Tell me about a time you found and fixed a security vulnerability."**
- S: Container scanning revealed Adminer with 2 CRITICAL CVEs
- T: No vendor patches available, service needed for database management
- A: Applied compensating controls (localhost binding, SSH tunnel access, network isolation)
- R: Reduced risk from CRITICAL to LOW while maintaining functionality

**2. "Describe a challenging technical problem you solved."**
- S: LocalAI server crashing due to VRAM exhaustion (17GB+ usage)
- T: Needed stable AI inference for ResumeWonder application
- A: Implemented automatic model unloading before each request
- R: 70% VRAM reduction (17GB → 5GB), eliminated crashes

**3. "How do you approach security monitoring?"**
- S: Built Home SOC from scratch to monitor production homelab
- T: Needed visibility across 7 heterogeneous Linux devices
- A: Deployed centralized stack (Grafana/Loki/Prometheus), automated deployment scripts
- R: Sub-minute detection, 70% attack surface reduction, 5-minute device onboarding

**4. "Tell me about a time you improved a process through automation."**
- S: Manual device hardening took 1-2 hours per device
- T: Needed to secure 7 devices quickly and consistently
- A: Created OS-detection deployment script with idempotent logic
- R: 5-minute deployment per device, zero errors, reproducible across OS distributions

**5. "How do you prioritize security work?"**
- S: Container vulnerability scan revealed 30+ vulnerabilities across all severities
- T: Limited time and resources to remediate
- A: Risk-based prioritization (CRITICAL first, impact analysis, compensating controls)
- R: Remediated 15+ CRITICAL/HIGH CVEs in 24-48 hours

*[Prepare 10 more STAR responses covering: teamwork, failure/learning, dealing with pressure, technical documentation, customer service, conflict resolution, time management, continuous learning, innovation/creativity, leadership]*

#### Technical Question Preparation (Week 7-8)

**Goal:** Answer technical questions confidently with homelab examples

**Common Technical Questions + Portfolio Answers:**

**Q: "What is defense in depth? Give an example."**
A: "Multiple layers of security controls. In my Raspberry Pi hardening, I implemented:
1. Network layer: Tailscale mesh VPN + LAN segmentation
2. Firewall layer: UFW with default-deny policy
3. Application layer: Vaultwarden restricted to Tailscale-only access
4. Intrusion prevention layer: fail2ban blocking brute-force attempts
5. Monitoring layer: Grafana alerting on security events
Each layer provides independent protection, so if one fails, others still defend."

**Q: "How does a SIEM work?"**
A: "My Home SOC uses SIEM principles:
1. Collection: Promtail agents ship logs from 7 devices to centralized Loki
2. Aggregation: Loki stores ~1000 log lines/minute with labels for filtering
3. Correlation: LogQL queries find patterns (SSH failures, container errors)
4. Visualization: Grafana dashboards show security events in real-time
5. Alerting: Triggered when thresholds exceeded (5 failed logins in 5 minutes)
I can detect SSH attacks fleet-wide and drill down to specific hosts using labels."

**Q: "Explain the vulnerability management lifecycle."**
A: "I follow a 6-step process in my homelab:
1. Discovery: Trivy scans all 30+ containers weekly
2. Prioritization: Risk-based scoring (CRITICAL/HIGH first, CVSS + exploitability)
3. Assessment: Determine applicability (is service exposed? compensating controls?)
4. Remediation: Patch if available, or apply compensating controls (Adminer example)
5. Verification: Rescan to confirm fix, test functionality
6. Documentation: Track in findings/ directory with CVE details and remediation steps"

**Q: "What is the difference between IDS and IPS?"**
A: "IDS detects and alerts (passive), IPS detects and blocks (active).
In my homelab, I use both:
- IDS: Grafana alerts on SSH failed logins (detection only, I decide response)
- IPS: fail2ban blocks IPs after 3 failed attempts (automatic prevention)
Planning to deploy Suricata for network IDS/IPS to detect malicious traffic patterns."

*[Prepare 20+ more technical Q&A covering: CIA triad, encryption, firewalls, authentication, access control, incident response, malware analysis, network protocols, OWASP Top 10, compliance frameworks]*

### Mock Interviews (Week 9-10)

## Contingency Plans

### If No Offers by Day 90

**Reassess Strategy:**
1. **Resume Review:** Get professional resume critique (resume.io, TopResume)
2. **Interview Skills:** More mock interviews, identify weak areas
3. **Portfolio Gap:** Add missing skills (cloud security, Python automation)
4. **Networking:** Attend more events, request more informational interviews
5. **Certifications:** Add CEH or CySA+ to stand out
6. **Broaden Search:** Apply to junior IT roles with security responsibilities
7. **Freelance/Contract:** Offer freelance security consulting via Upwork/Fiverr

### If Struggling with Security+ Exam

**Support Resources:**
- Join CompTIA Discord (study groups, Q&A)
- Professor Messer study group sessions (weekly live streams)
- TryHackMe Security+ channel (community support)
- Consider exam retake (CompTIA allows one free retake with CertMaster bundle)

### If Homelab Projects Become Overwhelming

**Simplify:**
- Focus on portfolio optimization over new projects
- Document existing work instead of building new features
- Reduce TryHackMe rooms to Security+-aligned only
- Postpone Wazuh/Honeypot/Suricata to post-employment

### If Burning Out

**Self-Care Reminders:**
- Study breaks every 60 minutes (Pomodoro technique)
- Maintain work-life balance (don't sacrifice sleep/health)
- Exercise 3x per week (mental clarity, stress reduction)
- Connect with support system (family, friends, mentors)
- Celebrate small wins (each application, each study milestone)
- Remember: This is a marathon, not a sprint
