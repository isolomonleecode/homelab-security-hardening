**Hiring Manager**
**Jr. Cybersecurity Analyst Position**
**Remote Jobs**

Dear Hiring Manager,

I'm writing to express my strong interest in the Jr. Cybersecurity Analyst position. When I read your job description mentioning vulnerability scanning, SIEM tools, and supporting healthcare clients with security assessments, I realized this role perfectly aligns with the hands-on security work I've been doing—both in my professional capacity at Insperity and through my self-directed homelab security projects.

## Why I'm a Strong Match

**Immediate Technical Readiness:**
Your job description mentions vulnerability scanning, firewall configuration, and SIEM tools as core requirements. I've been actively building these exact skills. In my homelab environment, I deployed a comprehensive security monitoring stack (Grafana, Prometheus, Loki) and reduced attack surface by 70% through systematic hardening: UFW firewall configuration, fail2ban intrusion prevention, network segmentation via Tailscale mesh, and vulnerability scanning using Nmap and OWASP ZAP. This wasn't theoretical learning—these are production services I maintain daily, including a password manager protecting 50+ credentials.

**Client-Facing Experience:**
At Insperity, I support 200+ clients remotely, resolving 20+ technical cases weekly. I lead client meetings, coordinate with vendors, and translate complex technical issues into clear recommendations—exactly what you need for "participating in customer meetings with health centers to review security findings." Being promoted twice demonstrates my ability to build trust and deliver consistent value in client relationships.

**Documentation & Communication:**
Your role emphasizes technical writing and documentation. My homelab security assessment documentation exceeds 3,500 lines, covering vulnerability findings, risk analysis, remediation tracking, and before/after configurations. As a CompTIA A+ instructor, I regularly explain cybersecurity concepts (password hygiene, malware prevention, network security) to non-technical adult learners, which translates directly to communicating security findings to healthcare clients.

## What Makes Me Different

Most candidates with 0-2 years of experience list certifications and theory. I bring:

- **Hands-on production experience:** Managing real infrastructure with real consequences (if my firewall config is wrong, my password vault becomes vulnerable)
- **Risk-based prioritization:** I documented security findings in a Priority 1-4 classification system and tackled the highest risks first—exactly what vulnerability management requires
- **Incident response mindset:** When my Nextcloud cloud storage had performance issues, I performed root cause analysis across three layers (application, container, system) and documented the resolution for future reference
- **Continuous learning:** TryHackMe training, homelab experimentation, and teaching others keeps me current with evolving threats

## Why Healthcare Security

Your emphasis on HIPAA compliance and healthcare IT resonates with me. At AT&T, I advised hundreds of customers on network security—helping non-technical people understand *why* security matters. Healthcare combines complex technology with vulnerable populations who need protection, which makes the security work particularly meaningful. The opportunity to support community health centers through your organization adds a mission-driven aspect I find compelling.

## What I'll Bring From Day One

- **Vulnerability scanning experience:** Ready to support your Nessus, Qualys, or similar platforms
- **SIEM familiarity:** My Grafana/Prometheus/Loki experience translates to Splunk, LogRhythm, or other enterprise SIEM tools
- **Firewall fundamentals:** UFW, iptables, and network segmentation understanding applies across vendors
- **Ticketing systems:** Daily experience at Insperity with case management and escalation procedures
- **Self-motivation:** Didn't wait for a security job to build security skills—I created my own lab and documented everything

## My Commitment

I'm not just looking for a job—I'm looking to build a cybersecurity career protecting organizations from real threats. Your role offers exactly what I need: structured mentorship, exposure to enterprise security tools, and the opportunity to support healthcare clients with meaningful security outcomes. In return, I bring technical curiosity, proven client relationship skills, and a track record of rapid learning (promoted twice at Insperity in under 3 years).

I'd welcome the opportunity to discuss how my hands-on security experience and client-facing background can contribute to your team's mission of supporting healthcare security. I'm particularly interested in learning more about your engagement model with community health centers and how your team approaches vulnerability remediation tracking.

Thank you for considering my application. I look forward to the possibility of demonstrating my technical skills and discussing how I can support your security service delivery.

Sincerely,

**Latrent Childs**
