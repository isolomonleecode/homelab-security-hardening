# Vulnerability Assessment Report

**Date:** October 23, 2025
**Auditor:** ssjlox
**Tool:** Trivy v0.55.2
**Scope:** 18 running Docker containers

## Executive Summary

This vulnerability assessment identifies security weaknesses in container images running in the homelab environment. Findings are prioritized by severity using CVSS (Common Vulnerability Scoring System) scores.

**Security+ Concept:** Vulnerability Management (Domain 1.3)
**Tools Used:** Trivy (Aqua Security)

## Assessment Methodology

### Scanning Approach
1. **Tool Selection:** Trivy - industry-standard container vulnerability scanner
2. **Scope:** All running containers on Unraid server (192.168.0.51)
3. **Severity Filter:** CRITICAL, HIGH, MEDIUM vulnerabilities
4. **Database:** National Vulnerability Database (NVD) + vendor-specific databases

### CVSS Severity Ratings

| Severity | CVSS Score | Action Timeline | Description |
|----------|------------|----------------|-------------|
| **CRITICAL** | 9.0 - 10.0 | Immediate (24-48 hours) | Remote code execution, complete system compromise |
| **HIGH** | 7.0 - 8.9 | Short-term (1-2 weeks) | Significant security impact, data exposure |
| **MEDIUM** | 4.0 - 6.9 | Medium-term (1 month) | Moderate security impact |
| **LOW** | 0.1 - 3.9 | Long-term (as convenient) | Minimal security impact |

## Scan Results Summary

*This section will be populated after scans complete*

### Overall Statistics

| Metric | Count |
|--------|-------|
| Containers Scanned | 0 |
| Total Vulnerabilities | 0 |
| Critical Severity | 0 |
| High Severity | 0 |
| Medium Severity | 0 |
| Low Severity | 0 |

### Risk Distribution

## Remediation Plan

### Immediate Actions (Critical)

*Vulnerabilities requiring immediate attention*

1. [ ] CVE-XXXX-XXXXX - [Container] - [Description]
   - **Action:** Update to version X.X.X
   - **ETA:** [date]

### Short-term Actions (High)

*Vulnerabilities to address within 1-2 weeks*

### Medium-term Actions (Medium)

*Vulnerabilities to address within 1 month*

## Risk Acceptance

Some vulnerabilities may be accepted based on:
- **Compensating Controls:** Other security measures in place
- **Limited Exposure:** Service not accessible from internet
- **No Patch Available:** Vendor hasn't released fix yet
- **Low Exploitability:** Difficult to exploit in practice

**Accepted Risks:**
*To be documented*

---

## Compliance & Best Practices

**Frameworks Applied:**
- NIST Cybersecurity Framework (Identify, Protect)
- CIS Docker Benchmark
- OWASP Container Security

**Security+ Learning Points:**
- Vulnerability identification and classification
- Risk-based prioritization methodology
- Patch management processes
- Security assessment documentation

## Remediation Verification

After implementing fixes, containers will be re-scanned to verify:
1. Vulnerability is no longer present
2. Update didn't introduce new issues
3. Container still functions correctly

**Re-scan Date:** [TBD]

## Appendix A: Scanning Commands

**Scan single container:**
```bash
trivy image --severity CRITICAL,HIGH,MEDIUM <image-name>
```

**Export JSON report:**
```bash
trivy image --format json --output report.json <image-name>
```

**Scan and ignore unfixed vulnerabilities:**
```bash
trivy image --ignore-unfixed <image-name>
```

## Appendix B: Container Image Inventory

| Container Name | Image | Version | Last Updated |
|----------------|-------|---------|--------------|
| postgresql17 | postgres | 17 | TBD |
| mariadb | linuxserver/mariadb | latest | TBD |
| jellyfin | binhex/arch-jellyfin | latest | TBD |
| ... | ... | ... | ... |
