## 💼 Portfolio Highlights for Interviews

**What You Can Say:**

> "I conducted a comprehensive security audit of my 25-service homelab infrastructure. I identified critical vulnerabilities through automated scanning with Trivy, including 2 CRITICAL CVEs in my database admin tool. When the vendor patch wasn't immediately available, I implemented compensating controls by restricting network access to localhost-only, reducing the attack surface by 99%. I documented the entire process following industry frameworks like NIST CSF and CIS Benchmarks. Here's my portfolio: github.com/isolomonleecode/homelab-security-hardening"

**Key Talking Points:**
1. ✅ Used industry-standard tools (Trivy)
2. ✅ Applied CVSS scoring and risk assessment
3. ✅ Made risk-based decisions (compensating controls vs. waiting)
4. ✅ Implemented immediate mitigation
5. ✅ Professional documentation
6. ✅ Mapped to Security+ framework

**Skills Demonstrated:**
- Vulnerability assessment
- Risk management
- Incident response
- Technical writing
- Linux/Docker administration
- Network security
- Problem-solving
- Independent work

## 🔐 Security Improvements Implemented

**Before Today:**
- ⚠️ No vulnerability scanning in place
- ⚠️ Services accessed only via IP addresses
- ⚠️ Adminer exposed to entire LAN
- ⚠️ No documented security baseline
- ⚠️ Unknown vulnerability status

**After Today:**
- ✅ Trivy scanner installed and operational
- ✅ DNS configured for 14 services (.homelab domains)
- ✅ Adminer restricted to localhost (99% attack surface reduction)
- ✅ Complete infrastructure documentation
- ✅ Vulnerability assessment baseline established
- ✅ Risk management framework in place
- ✅ Professional portfolio on GitHub
