# Adminer Vulnerability Remediation Plan

**Date:** October 23, 2025
**Container:** Adminer (Database Administration Tool)
**Risk Level:** CRITICAL (2 CRITICAL + 2 HIGH CVEs)

---

## Vulnerability Summary

| CVE | Severity | Type | Impact | Fixed Version |
|-----|----------|------|--------|---------------|
| CVE-2025-49794 | CRITICAL | Heap use-after-free | Denial of Service | libxml2 2.13.9-r0 |
| CVE-2025-49796 | CRITICAL | Type confusion | Denial of Service | libxml2 2.13.9-r0 |
| CVE-2025-49795 | HIGH | Null pointer deref | Denial of Service | libxml2 2.13.9-r0 |
| CVE-2025-6021 | HIGH | Integer overflow | Stack buffer overflow | libxml2 2.13.9-r0 |

**Current Situation:**
- Adminer latest image (adminer:latest) uses Alpine 3.22.2
- Alpine 3.22.2 includes libxml2 2.13.8-r0 (vulnerable)
- Fix available in libxml2 2.13.9-r0 (Alpine 3.22.3+)
- **Upstream has not yet rebuilt Adminer image with updated Alpine**

---

## Risk Assessment

**Security+ Domain 5.2: Risk Management Process**

### Threat Analysis

**Exploitability:** MEDIUM
- All CVEs require specific XML input to trigger
- Primarily DoS (service crash) not RCE (code execution)
- Attacker needs network access to Adminer

**Current Exposure:** LOW-MEDIUM
- ✅ Not exposed to internet
- ⚠️ Accessible from entire LAN (0.0.0.0:8087)
- ⚠️ Provides access to all databases (PostgreSQL, MariaDB)
- ⚠️ No authentication beyond database credentials

**Business Impact if Exploited:**
- **Availability:** Database admin tool unavailable (DoS)
- **Confidentiality:** No direct data breach (DoS only)
- **Integrity:** Minimal (unless combined with other attacks)

### Risk Calculation

**Likelihood:** Medium (requires LAN access + specific input)
**Impact:** Medium (service disruption, not data breach)
**Overall Risk:** MEDIUM

---

## Remediation Options

### Option 1: Wait for Upstream Update ⏳

**Action:** Monitor Adminer releases for Alpine 3.22.3+ base image

**Pros:**
- Official, supported solution
- No custom maintenance required
- Simple: `docker pull adminer:latest && docker restart adminer`

**Cons:**
- Unknown timeline (could be days/weeks)
- Vulnerability remains open during wait
- No control over update timing

**Timeline:** Unknown (vendor-dependent)

**Recommendation:** ⭐ **Combine with Option 3** (compensating controls)

---

### Option 2: Build Custom Image 🛠️

**Action:** Create custom Adminer image with Alpine 3.22.3+

```dockerfile
# Dockerfile
FROM alpine:3.22.3 as base
RUN apk --no-cache add libxml2=2.13.9-r0

FROM adminer:latest
COPY --from=base /usr/lib/libxml2.so.2 /usr/lib/
```

**Pros:**
- Immediate fix
- Full control over dependencies
- Learning opportunity (Docker image building)

**Cons:**
- Custom maintenance burden
- Must rebuild on Adminer updates
- Potential compatibility issues
- Complexity

**Timeline:** 1-2 hours to implement and test

**Recommendation:** ⚠️ **Not recommended** for homelab (maintenance overhead)

---

### Option 3: Implement Compensating Controls ✅

**Action:** Reduce attack surface through access controls

**Immediate Actions:**

1. **Restrict Network Access**
   ```bash
   # Recreate container with localhost-only binding
   docker stop adminer
   docker rm adminer
   docker run -d \
     --name adminer \
     --restart unless-stopped \
     -p 127.0.0.1:8087:8080 \  # localhost only!
     adminer
   ```

2. **Access via SSH Tunnel**
   ```bash
   # From your workstation
   ssh -L 8087:localhost:8087 root@192.168.0.51
   # Then access: http://localhost:8087
   ```

3. **Update Pi-hole DNS** (Remove adminer.homelab record)
   ```bash
   # On Pi-hole server
   ssh sweetrpi@192.168.0.19
   docker exec pihole sed -i '/adminer.homelab/d' /etc/dnsmasq.d/04-local-dns.conf
   docker exec pihole pihole reloaddns
   ```

**Pros:**
- ✅ Immediate implementation (5 minutes)
- ✅ Significantly reduces attack surface
- ✅ No custom code to maintain
- ✅ Follows principle of least privilege
- ✅ Forces intentional access (security by design)

**Cons:**
- Slightly less convenient (requires SSH tunnel)
- Doesn't eliminate vulnerability, only mitigates

**Timeline:** 5 minutes

**Recommendation:** ⭐⭐⭐ **HIGHLY RECOMMENDED**

---

### Option 4: Replace with Alternative 🔄

**Action:** Use different database admin tool

**Alternatives:**
- **DBeaver** (desktop application, more secure)
- **phpMyAdmin** (if only using MySQL/MariaDB)
- **pgAdmin** (if only using PostgreSQL)
- **Command-line tools** (psql, mysql - most secure)

**Pros:**
- May have better security posture
- Specialized tools often have more features
- Eliminates web-based attack surface

**Cons:**
- Learning curve for new tool
- May lose multi-database support
- Time investment to migrate

**Timeline:** 2-4 hours (research + migration)

**Recommendation:** ⚠️ **Consider for future** (not immediate priority)

---

## Selected Approach: Option 3 (Compensating Controls)

**Decision Rationale:**
1. **Immediate mitigation** available (5 min vs hours/weeks)
2. **Low operational impact** (SSH tunnel is standard practice)
3. **Defense in depth** principle (reduce attack surface)
4. **Reversible** (can easily revert if needed)
5. **Best practice** (database tools shouldn't be LAN-accessible)

---

## Implementation Plan

### Phase 1: Immediate Mitigation (Do Now)

**Step 1: Backup Current Configuration**
```bash
ssh root@100.69.191.4 "docker inspect adminer > /tmp/adminer-config-backup.json"
```

**Step 2: Recreate with Restricted Access**
```bash
ssh root@100.69.191.4 << 'EOF'
# Stop and remove current container
docker stop adminer
docker rm adminer

# Recreate with localhost binding
docker run -d \
  --name adminer \
  --restart unless-stopped \
  -p 127.0.0.1:8087:8080 \
  adminer

# Verify it's only listening on localhost
netstat -tlnp | grep 8087
EOF
```

**Step 3: Test Access via SSH Tunnel**
```bash
# From your workstation
ssh -L 8087:localhost:8087 root@100.69.191.4 -N -f

# Access in browser
firefox http://localhost:8087

# Test database connectivity
```

**Step 4: Update Documentation**
- Update infrastructure inventory
- Add to operational runbook
- Document SSH tunnel access method

**Time Required:** 10 minutes

---

### Phase 2: Monitor for Upstream Fix (Ongoing)

**Weekly Check:**
```bash
# Pull latest image
docker pull adminer:latest

# Scan for vulnerabilities
trivy image --severity CRITICAL,HIGH adminer:latest

# If fixed, update container
docker stop adminer && docker rm adminer
# Recreate with updated image (same command as Phase 1)
```

**Automation Opportunity:**
- Set calendar reminder (weekly)
- Or use Watchtower for auto-updates (already running)
- Monitor Adminer GitHub releases

---

## Verification & Testing

### Post-Remediation Checks

1. **✅ Access Control Verified**
   ```bash
   # From external machine on LAN
   curl http://192.168.0.51:8087
   # Should FAIL (connection refused)

   # From localhost (via SSH)
   curl http://localhost:8087
   # Should SUCCESS (Adminer login page)
   ```

2. **✅ Database Connectivity**
   - Test PostgreSQL connection
   - Test MariaDB connection
   - Verify all databases accessible

3. **✅ Vulnerability Status**
   ```bash
   # Re-scan (should still show vulns, but risk accepted)
   trivy image adminer:latest
   ```

---

## Risk Acceptance Statement

**After implementing compensating controls:**

**Accepted Risk:** Adminer container contains 4 libxml2 vulnerabilities (2 CRITICAL, 2 HIGH)

**Justification for Acceptance:**
1. ✅ Compensating control implemented (localhost-only access)
2. ✅ Attack vector significantly reduced (LAN → localhost)
3. ✅ Impact limited to DoS (no data breach risk)
4. ✅ Monitoring in place for upstream fix
5. ✅ Alternative access method documented (SSH tunnel)

**Residual Risk:** LOW
- Requires compromised host system for exploitation
- If host is compromised, database access is already available
- DoS impact acceptable for homelab environment

**Review Date:** Weekly until upstream fix available
**Approved By:** ssjlox (Infrastructure Owner)
**Date:** October 23, 2025

**Interview Talking Points:**
> "I discovered critical vulnerabilities in my database admin interface through automated scanning. While a complete fix wasn't immediately available from the vendor, I implemented compensating controls by restricting network access and requiring SSH tunnels, reducing the attack surface by 99% within 10 minutes. I documented the risk acceptance decision and established monitoring for the upstream fix."

## Lessons Learned

1. **Not all vulnerabilities have immediate fixes** - vendor update timelines vary
2. **Compensating controls are valid** - defense in depth, not perfection
3. **DoS ≠ RCE** - severity matters, but context matters more
4. **Convenience vs. Security** - SSH tunnels are worth the extra step
5. **Document decisions** - justify why you did or didn't fix something
